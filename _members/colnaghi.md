    I am Postdoctoral Researcher at the Amsterdam Cooperation Lab (AML), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, working on the evolution of human cooperation. The main aim of my research is to use agent-based modelling and evolutionary game theory to study the relationship between fitness interdependence and the evolution of cooperative behaviour. Main supervisor: Daniel Balliet.
