    Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Prosocial Dynamics Lab, at the Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems group (SIAS). I work on mathematical models based on evolutionary concepts and game theory to understand social behaviour, such as how individuals learn to cooperate. In my postdoc I work on the “Algorithmic Fairness and Accuracy in Adaptive Populations” project in collaboration with ING. We explore the population dynamics of strategic individuals adapting to classification algorithms. I completed my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology.
