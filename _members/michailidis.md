    I am a PhD student at the Civic AI Lab of the University of Amsterdam. In my research, I use Machine Learning to design inclusive, accessible and sustainable cities. My current focus is on using Reinforcement Learning to explore the trade-off between utility and equity/fairness when designing public transport networks. In the near future, I would like to investigate how would urban populations adapt to such changes in a city's public tranport networks.
