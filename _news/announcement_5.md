Excited to participate onsite in AAMAS once again, after 3 virtual years! I'm speaking in the Doctoral Consortium panel on carreer advice for PhD students. My group will present 3 papers in the main conference (1 full, 2 posters) and 3 papers in satellite workshops (ALA and C-MAS). See you in London!
