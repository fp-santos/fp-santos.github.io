Just back from a fantastic ECAI, where Alex presented his work on [Indirect Reciprocity in Hybrid Populations](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/69964) and Dimitris presented on [Multi-objective RL applied to Public Transit Design](https://modem2024.vub.ac.be). Well done! I'm also very happy with the [Doctoral Consortium](https://anaellewilczynski.pages.centralesupelec.fr/ecai-2024-dc/index.html) â€”- really rewarding to see so many commited PhD students and exciting ideas!
