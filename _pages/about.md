I am an Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute](https://ivi.uva.nl) of the University of Amsterdam. I am part of the [SIAS group](https://www.sias-uva.nl), where I lead the [Prosocial Dynamics Lab](/lab) and I am one of scientific lab managers of the [Civic AI Lab](https://www.civic-ai.nl).

**My research lies at the interface of AI and Complex Systems: I study behavioral dynamics in systems of adaptive learning agents and aim at designing prosocial/fair AI** ([more info](/research)).

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton with [Simon A. Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu), supported by a [James S. McDonnell Foundation Fellowship](https://grants.jsmf.org/2017031/). I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering (2018) at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic) with [Francisco C. Santos](http://web.ist.utl.pt/franciscocsantos/index.html), [Jorge M. Pacheco](http://www.atpgroup.org/jmp/), and [Ana Paiva](https://ana-paiva.com); my work received the [Victor Lesser Dissertation Award](https://www.ifaamas.org/award-victorlesser.html) (2018), the [APPIA Best Thesis in AI](http://www.appia.pt/2019/09/09/melhor-tese-de-doutoramento-em-inteligencia-artificial-2017-2018/) (2017-2018) and the [INESC-ID PhD Student award](https://www.inesc-id.pt/news-events/awards/) (2018). I was selected for the AAAI-23 New Faculty Highlights program.
