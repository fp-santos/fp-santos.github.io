I am an Assistant Professor at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam. I am part of the SIAS group, where I lead the Prosocial Dynamics Lab, and I am the Scientific Lab Manager of the Civic AI Lab.

My research lies at the interface of AI and Complex Systems: I aim at modelling behavioral dynamics in systems of adaptive learning agents, understanding human cooperation, and designing prosocial AI.

My research is currently supported by an ERC Starting Grant (RE-LINK) to understand the impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in human social dynamics. 

Before joining UvA, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University, with Simon A. Levin and supported by a James S. McDonnell Foundation Fellowship. I completed my PhD (2018) at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST, Lisboa) with Francisco C. Santos, Jorge M. Pacheco, and Ana Paiva; my thesis received the Victor Lesser Distinguished Dissertation Award, the APPIA Best Doctoral Thesis in AI 2017-2018 and the INESC-ID best PhD Student award.
