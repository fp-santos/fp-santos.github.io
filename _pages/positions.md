## PhD positions: Responsible Link-Recommendations in Dynamic Environments  

   


Have you always wanted to develop computational models to understand human social dynamics? Are you passionate about developing recommendation algorithms that are fair and positively impact society? Do you enjoy working in an interdisciplinary research setting, at the interface of computer science, recommendation systems, computational social science, and behavioral sciences? If so, we have the right position for you! We are looking for ambitious doctoral students to join the ERC project RE-LINK (Responsible Link-Recommendations in Dynamic Environments).
 
With the project RE-LINK, we aim at developing new computational models to evaluate 1) the long-term societal impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in online social networks and 2) design a new paradigm of link-recommenders that incentivize cooperation, collective action, and misinformation control. It is urgent to understand how algorithms used in online social media impact human behavioral dynamics given the widespread use of social media platforms and the evidence that they contribute to exacerbate radicalization, misinformation, and incite hate. This is a challenging endeavor. Online platforms are nowadays complex ecosystems where millions of humans influence each other while co-existing with AI algorithms. Governing online social networks requires understanding the impact of link-recommenders and how to adapt them to ensure long-term benefits.
 
This project will resort to mathematical and computational tools such as evolutionary game theory, network science, graph representation learning and recommendation algorithms. We will hire 3 PhD students to work on different components of the project: 
 
* **Position 1:** Study the long-term impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in cooperation dynamics and collective action dilemmas.
* **Position 2:** Study the long-term impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in radicalization and misinformation. 
* **Position 3:** Develop and evaluate new link-recommendation algorithms that consider long-term impacts in social dynamics.
 
We are looking for a profile combining a strong computational and mathematical background with curiosity, passion for scientific research and eagerness to comprehend social dynamics in hybrid systems where AI and humans co-exist. Let us know how your experience and interests fits with any of these positions.

### Tasks and responsibilities: 

* Conduct independent research in the area(s) of multi-agent systems simulation, dynamics on complex networks, graph representation learning and/or recommendation algorithms (depending on the relevant position as described above);
* Develop new (optimized) computational models and systematically evaluate them locally and in high performance computing clusters;
* Read scientific literature and creatively suggest new research directions grounded in recent articles, in connection with the RE-LINK project;
* Present research results at international conferences and workshops and write research articles to be published in academic journals and book chapters;
* Be an active member of our research community, participate in regular meetings and collaborate with other researchers at RE-LINK, SIAS and the Informatics Institute;
* Assist in teaching activities and/or supervising students.
* Complete and defend a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years.

### Your experience and profile:
* An MSc degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Applied Mathematics/Physics, Complex Systems or related fields;
* A strong background/knowledge in computational modeling. Experience with evolutionary game theory and network science is a plus.
* Excellent programming skills preferably in Python, C++, Mathematica, or related languages.
* Strong communication, presentation and writing skills and an excellent command of English;
* Highly motivated, independent, and creative;
* Socially engaged, highly motivated to work in a multidisciplinary environment.
 
### Applications should include the following information:
* A motivation letter that motivates your choice for this position (max 1 page); Please indicate your ordered preference for the positions listed above;
* Curriculum vitae, including your list of publications if applicable;
* A research statement on how to approach the project. Solid and creative ideas will be greatly appreciated. (max 1 page);
* A link to your Masterâ€™s thesis. If not yet completed, a 1-page summary of goals and 1 figure summarizing the key results so far will suffice;
* A complete record of Bachelor and Master courses (including grades and explanation of grading system);
* The names and contact addresses of at least two academic references (please do not include any recommendation letters).
 
**Application deadline:** February 6, 2024  
**Interviews date (online and/or onsite):** February 14-28, 2024  
**Expected start date:** Summer/Fall, 2024  
 

**If you are interested in these positions, please reach out for more information and manifestation of interest (f.p.santos@uva.nl). Soon an official application link to upload your materials will be posted.**
