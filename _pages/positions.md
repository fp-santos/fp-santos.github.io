## PhD position(s): Responsible Link-Recommendations and Social Dynamics  
--  

Have you always wanted to develop computational models to understand human social dynamics? Are you passionate about designing recommendation algorithms that are fair and positively impact society? Do you enjoy working in an international and interdisciplinary research setting, at the interface of computer science, recommendation systems, computational social science, and behavioral sciences? If so, we have the right position for you! We are looking for ambitious doctoral students to join the ERC project RE-LINK (Responsible Link-Recommendations in Dynamic Environments), at the University of Amsterdam.
 
With project RE-LINK, we aim at developing new computational models to evaluate 1) the long-term societal impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in online social networks and 2) design a new paradigm of link-recommenders that incentivize cooperation, fairness, collective action, and misinformation control. 
 
This project will resort to mathematical and computational tools such as (evolutionary) game theory, network science, graph representation learning and recommendation systems. We will hire 3 PhD students to work on different components of the project: 
 
* **Position 1:** Study the long-term impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in cooperation dynamics and collective action dilemmas.
* **Position 2:** Study the long-term impacts of link-recommendation algorithms in radicalization, polarization and misinformation. 
* **Position 3:** Develop and evaluate new link-recommendation algorithms that consider long-term impacts in social dynamics.
 
We are looking for a profile combining a strong computational and mathematical background with curiosity, passion for scientific research and eagerness to comprehend social dynamics in hybrid systems where AI and humans co-exist. Let us know how your experience and interests fit with any of these positions.


### Tasks and responsibilities: 

This project will be conducted at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam. the selected candidates will work at the [Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems (SIAS)](https://www.sias-uva.nl) group, in the new [Prosocial Dynamics Lab](/lab). The candidates are expected to:

* Conduct independent research in the area(s) of multi-agent systems simulation, dynamics on complex networks, graph representation learning and/or recommendation algorithms (depending on the relevant position as described above);
* Develop new (optimized) computational models and systematically evaluate them locally and in high performance computing clusters;
* Read scientific literature and creatively suggest new research directions grounded in recent articles, in connection with the RE-LINK project;
* Present research results at international conferences and workshops and write research articles to be published in academic journals and book chapters;
* Be an active member of our research community, participate in regular meetings and collaborate with other researchers at the Informatics Institute;
* Assist in teaching activities and/or supervising students.
* Complete and defend a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years.

### Your experience and profile:
* An MSc degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Applied Mathematics/Physics, Complex Systems or related fields;
* A strong background/knowledge in computational modeling. Experience with evolutionary game theory and network science is a plus.
* Excellent programming skills preferably in Python, C++, Mathematica, or related languages.
* Strong communication, presentation and writing skills and an excellent command of English;
* Highly motivated, independent, and creative;
* Socially engaged, eager to work in a multidisciplinary environment.

 
### Applications should include the following information:
* A motivation letter that motivates your choice for this position; Please indicate your ordered preference for the positions listed above (max 1 page);
* A research statement on how to approach the project. Solid and creative ideas will be greatly appreciated (max 2 page);
* Curriculum vitae, including your list of publications if applicable;
* A link to your Masterâ€™s thesis. If not yet completed, a 1-page summary of goals and 1 figure summarizing the key results so far will suffice;
* A complete record of Bachelor and Master courses (including grades and explanation of grading system);
* The names and contact addresses of at least two academic references (please do not include any recommendation letters).  


**Application deadline:** February 6, 2024  
**Interviews date (online and/or onsite):** February/March, 2024  
**Expected start date:** Summer/Fall, 2024  
 

**If you have questions about these positions, please reach out for more information and manifestation of interest (f.p.santos@uva.nl).**
