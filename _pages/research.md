Simple human actions can, over time, result in complex collective dynamics. Some of these dynamics are desirable, such as cooperation and pro-sociality. Some are concerning, such as conflict, bias, and discrimination. Human social dynamics are nowadays impacted by AI through new algorithmic recommendations and interaction paradigms. How can we formalize mathematically the dynamics of human collective behavior? How can selfish parts sustain a cooperative whole? How to harness artificial intelligence applications to sustain pro-sociality within systems of artificial learning agents and humans? These questions fascinate me and drive my work. My research lies at the interface of AI and Complex Systems: I study behavioral dynamics in systems of adaptive learning agents and aim at designing prosocial/fair AI.
